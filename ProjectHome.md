**Note: The code here is, probably, not functional, as CFA do change the RSS format from time to time. I've not updated the code as the 2009 Bushfire Royal Commission is leading to a lot of changes. The CFA are updating their web information.**



## Introduction ##
An RSS reader customised for the special needs of reading the CFA incident RSS feed. No touch real time updates of incidents filtered by CFA region. Links to Google maps for general incident locations.
